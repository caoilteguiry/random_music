This script plays a pseudo-random sequence of songs from your music 
collection. It works by creating an index of all of the songs in your music
collection and then picking a random line/entry from that index file and 
playing it.

To run, type:
$ python random_music.py

If it is your first time running, you will be asked to specify a music
directory for the configuration file. The index file will then be generated.
You can skip through songs by pressing ctrl+c, and can exit by holding
ctrl+c. 

To see command line options, type:
$ python random_music.py -h

The script also supports filename matching, so you may also try the following:
$ python random_music.py david bowie
$ python random_music.py david bowie OR lou reed OR rolling stones

This script will currently only work with unix-variants (e.g. linux, mac),
but I hopefully should get around to making it cross-platform compatible at
some point. 

If you do not have mplayer installed, you can edit the config file (config.txt)
and set music_client to something else.
