This script plays a pseudo-random sequence of songs from your music 
collection. It works by creating an index of all of the songs in your music
collection and then picking a random line/entry from that index file and 
playing it.

To install, type:
$ python setup.py install

You may need administrative privileges to do this. 

To run, type:
$ music

If it is your first time running, you will be asked to specify a music
directory for the configuration file. The index file will then be generated.

If you do not have mplayer installed, you will be asked to specify a music
client. Command-line music players are preferable (e.g. SoX's play)

You can skip through songs by pressing ctrl+c, and can exit by holding
ctrl+c. 

To see command line options, type:
$ music -h

The script also supports filename matching, so you may also try the following:
$ music david bowie
$ music david bowie OR lou reed OR rolling stones
